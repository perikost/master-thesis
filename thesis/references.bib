We first discuss opportunities and challenges in the integration of blockchain and biometrics, with emphasis in biometric template storage and protection, a key problem in biometrics still largely unsolved. Blockchain technologies provide excellent architectures and practical tools for securing and managing the sensitive and private data stored in biometric templates, but at a cost. We explore experimentally the key tradeoffs involved in that integration, namely: latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric performance. We experimentally study those factors by implementing a smart contract on Ethereum for biometric template storage, whose cost-performance is evaluated by varying the complexity of state-of-the-art schemes for face and handwriting signature biometrics. We report our experiments using popular benchmarks in biometrics research, including deep learning approaches and databases captured in the wild. As a result, we experimentally show that straightforward schemes for data storage in blockchain (i.e., direct and hash-based) may be prohibitive for biometric template storage using state-of-the-art biometric methods. A good cost-performance tradeoff is shown by using a blockchain approach based on Merkle trees.},

  abstract = {The adoption of agricultural products traceability management based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides excellent benefits for the current food safety issues. The provenance data can demonstrate agricultural products movement process from the countryside to the dining table. However, the massive provenance data incurs an inefficient query. Meanwhile, the provenance data can be tampered deliberately which affect food safety. There are seldom reported approaches that can solve the above problem effectively. In this paper, we propose a data storage model based on Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain. First, IPFS is used to store video, images, and real-time monitoring data reported from the sensors. Then, in order to avoid a malicious user in case of data faking attack, we exploit the blockchain to store the IPFS hash address of the provenance data. Based on that, we design an authentication mechanism based on blockchain. It can verify the data and ensures effective data security. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperforms the existing methods. © Computer Society of the Republic of China. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices' sampled data in Agriculture is important as any malicious tampering or destroy may lead to wrong decision making and causes immeasurable losses. On the other hand, the emerging blockchain technology provides safer solutions in data protection and retracing. Yet when blockchain technology applied in agricultural data tracking and storage, the identity based searching is long and difficult. Also, public blockchain or consortium blockchain technology along cannot provide satisfactory solutions balancing between safety and high system performance. In this paper, we propose an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) storage based double-blockchain solution for agricultural sampled data protection in IoT network. We use IPFS network to store the content of sampled data; the proposed system can retrieve the complete data segment by oracle mechanism. Then we design a consortium blockchain, Agricultural Sample Data Chain (ASDC), based on Ethereum technology and improve Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) based account for every category of sampled data. Finally, after the data are stored in blocks in ASDC, block hash will be generated and upload on main chain of Ethereum to keep a public record in case malicious attacks occurs. Simulated results show that our proposed method has smaller time consumption than cloud storage and blockchain only storage; as well as our system is more robust than other two systems.}

The IPFS network is public and its content can be accessed by any user in the Internet. IPFS can also be used as a file sharing system in an isolated private network. However, it has notable writing and reading performance drawbacks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of IPFS writing and reading operations in private networks and to understand what factors affect it. In our performance evaluation approach, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is selected as the baseline measurement, a virtual network of three nodes (machines) is established, and nine random files with different sizes are transmitted among the network members, using both IPFS and FTP, while the latency and CPU time, as performance metrics, are recorded and analyzed. The analysis shows that IPFS writing and reading performance is much worser than FTP, the reading operations latency is getting worser as the file size increases, IPFS writing and reading performance bottleneck is in the local I/O disk operations, which increase as the number of the file data blocks increases (i.e. the file size increases), and the reading performance of IPFS degrades as the data become more popular in the network. The performance evaluation illustrates that using IPFS in private networks is not as good as using the client-server alternatives, and IPFS needs more improvements to compete with the existing client-server file sharing technologies.},

For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the ``Decentralized Web'' attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform \textemdash{} the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) \textemdash{} an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of thirdparty applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

  abstract = {Decentralized, distributed storage offers a way to reduce the impact of data silos as often fostered by centralized cloud storage. While the intentions of this trend are not new, the topic gained traction due to technological advancements, most notably blockchain networks. As a consequence, we observe that a new generation of peer-to-peer data networks emerges. In this survey paper, we therefore provide a technical overview of the next generation data networks. We use select data networks to introduce general concepts and to emphasize new developments. Specifically, we provide a deeper outline of the Interplanetary File System and a general overview of Swarm, the Hypercore Protocol, SAFE, Storj, and Arweave. We identify common building blocks and provide a qualitative comparison. From the overview, we derive future challenges and research goals concerning data networks.},

  abstract = {In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer referenced; such memory is called garbage. Garbage collection was invented by American computer scientist John McCarthy around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.Garbage collection relieves the programmer from doing manual memory management, where the programmer specifies what objects to de-allocate and return to the memory system and when to do so. Other, similar techniques include stack allocation, region inference, and memory ownership, and combinations thereof. Garbage collection may take a significant proportion of a program's total processing time, and affect performance as a result. Resources other than memory, such as network sockets, database handles, windows, file descriptors, and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection, but rather by other methods (e.g. destructors). Some such methods de-allocate memory also.},
